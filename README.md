The official game of Jonah and David for the 2017-2018 FBLA competition.                                                                                                                                                                                                             We are creating a small pixel sandbox rpg based on the life of a FBLA member.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Description and Requirements:                                                                                                       Computer Game & Simulation Programming                                                                                             Category: Prejudged Projects & Simulation Programming
Type: Individual or Team
Topic: A sandbox is a style of game in which minimal character limitations are placed on the gamer, 
allowing the gamer to roam and change a virtual world at will. In contrast to a progression-style game, 
a sandbox game emphasizes roaming and allows a gamer to select tasks. Instead of featuring segmented areas or numbered levels,
a sandbox game usually occurs in a “world” to which the gamer has full access from start to finish. 
Create an original sandbox-style game that revolves around a year in the life of a typical FBLA member and the 
varied activities that he/she can become involved in; such as competitive events, fundraising, community service,
national membership programs, and national recognition programs. The game must:
-Run on a PC using Windows 7 or newer
-Be virus and malware free
-Run solely by keyboard stroke
-Qualify for a maximum ESRB rating of E10+
